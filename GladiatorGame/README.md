# **Gladiator**

Third Person beat-them all made with Unreal Engine 2.26.

# Controls
- **WASD** : Move in the camera space.
- **Left click** : Attack
- **Right click** : Defend
- **Middle click** : Lock-on on the nearest enemy

***Know bugs***
===
- When the player spam-clicks very quickly, the attack animation is slow
- Sometimes the ennemies do not rotate correctly

***Issues during development***
===
- Several times the components of the gladiators  become null causing us to lose days of development
